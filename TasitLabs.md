### Tasit Labs
At Tasit Labs (the company kicking off the Tasit project), we're building mobile Ethereum dapps (and creating an SDK for devs to do the same).

##### Benefits
Tasit Labs cares very much about inclusion, and we aim to hire lots of people from diverse backgrounds. Many startups say they care about inclusion, but we actually do! It's literally our top priority. We'll be working very hard to build a supportive environment with no jerks. Working from home a day a week is encouraged, and most (85%) of our hires will be remote. Most of us will be on a "maker schedule", so we block off 4+ hour uninterrupted blocks of time in everyone's calendars. We're fans of maternity and paternity leave, and we encourage taking plenty of (paid) time for this. We support intellectual curiosity and questioning everything. The soundest reasoning and best data determine the way forward at Tasit Labs regardless of where these ideas come from. Tasit Labs is a lean organization, and new product changes are framed as testable hypotheses (whenever possible - not trying to get stuck in any local minima here). You'll be one of the first hires at Tasit Labs, and our hope is that you want to grow with the company in a maaaajor way. Plus all of the standard things like health insurance and dental insurance - we'll work with you to sort this out quickly for remote people.

### General info
Now for a few debatable but strongly held beliefs about what would make you a good fit for this role. Hopefully you:
* Have great communication skills
* Work in a quick and iterative manner
* Are motivated by building product
* Can learn things on the job (in other words, passion + intellect > experience)
* Value self-taught people as much as those with academic degrees

What's up with the emphasis on communication skills?
* We'll have to get along, and we value clear, honest communication - and a good sense of humor.
* The difference between a friendly, casual error message and a technical, soulless one is everything.
* If you can't explain something in simple terms, you probably don't understand it very well.
* Communication skills are a good indicator of the ability to reason through problems.
* They'll also be very important when you're leading a team - being on the same page can save entire weeks here and there.
* On a small team, you'll wear many hats. This probably includes writing the occasional blog post or creating more job postings, and a fun tone in these with almost no typos will go a looong way. Haha which isn't to say we nailed this one, but we're trying.

In closing, diversity, diversity, diversity. Seriously.
